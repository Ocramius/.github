# Code of Conduct

I don't use a formal code of conduct for **my** projects.

The rationale for that is that these are personal projects
that are worked upon (by everyone) in good faith, and I will
exercise my own unilateral judgment on anything I believe
to be detrimental to myself, my mental health, or the 
well-being of other contributors and collaborators of my
projects.

There is no formal process for being booted from my projects
either, but expect me to retaliate on any ill-intended activity.

At the time of this writing, there are 8 billion other human
beings that I'd rather talk to than you, should you wish to
be a nuisance to my eyes.
