# Why do I do open source?

Open Source, for me personally, is an expression of creativity
and technical excellence, thrown out in the public for everyone
to learn, copy and improve themselves from it.

I do it because I am ecstatic when I design new code, and because
I  believe that I should regularly exercise coding at the best of
my capabilities.

My projects may not be the "best" out there, since everyone does 
measure with their own units, but I certainly try to express the
best that I can do with my skill, experience and continuous effort.

I avoid cutting corners, because:

 * there's already a paid daytime-job for that
 * there are enough projects out there that do this, mostly to
   win popularity contests

I also do work on very legacy projects, some of which are stuck
on technologies from more than a decade ago. Those projects are
stuck there because engineering is not allowed to move them, and
that can be for very good reasons that are not up to me to argue
with.

This corner of the codeverse is mine to decide where engineering
steers towards, and this capability is extremely precious to me.

## Permissive licenses versus "free and open source software"

I do release my work under some of the most permissive open source
licenses (MIT, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause).

I did not put much thought into **why** I choose them, but permissive
licenses  allow for larger organizations (reads: anyone with a "legal
department") to use my software as they wish.

The fact that my software can be  used freely is something that I
will probably change in the future, since there is much good to be
done by stopping corporate greed from abusing work done in good
faith.

There's an excellent talk by [Larry Garfield](https://github.com/crell)
that exposes the problem in detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJpXhVD18-c

## I don't do this for you

Some may think that open source comes out of my "good heart" (or
some other bullshit expression like that).

No: I do it because I want to code, and I want to keep my edge with
what's latest and greatest out there. Selfish, isn't it?

In practice, I do gain directly from publishing projects out there:

 * free publicity: as a freelance consultant, these projects do provide
   the visibility that some poor devils are often paid with at the
   beginning of their career. While I did pass through that stage in
   my career history, I do have steady income from
   an actual job that pays, and this is a "bonus" now.
 * occasional consulting gigs: open source does not pay (yet), but
   sometimes provides for some interesting client work that is worth
   picking up, for monetary or personal interest reasons.
 * having a voice: without these technical achievements, relevance
   in the technical ecosystems I work in is hard to obtain.
   While harsh, the reality is that the work you do has an effect on
   who you are perceived as, and therefore opinions are given different
   weights based on that.
 * sponsorship: I do get financial returns through [Tidelift](https://tidelift.com/)
   and [Github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Ocramius), for
   which I am extremely grateful, but for which I also never worked
   directly.
   After a decade in OSS, both these platforms came in as
   a "wow, finally?" reaction, rather than a change in direction and
   interests.
   We are still far from having sustainable open source work, and
   these tools only provide an imperceptible fraction of my income,
   at the time of this writing.
 * stress relief: while open source users are often a big source of
   stress and gripe on my end, I take refuge in my OSS work when my
   mind makes it feel like the world around me is collapsing. This
   little corner of the world helps me maintain the sanity, especially
   after a long day of work where I may have had to take all the wrong
   decisions due to external constraints that I cannot control.
   
All of the above are certainly things I gain from directly, but
are also not the "why" I do open source, rather interesting perks
that come with it, after having worked on it for a decade, often
for many sleepless weeks at a time.

## You do matter

It may sound harsh to read "I don't do this for you" from a maintainer
of projects that you directly rely upon, but rest assure that I take
users of my projects in high consideration.

For years, my [twitter bio](https://twitter.com/ocramius) spelled:

 > I'm a tad blunt, but I mean no harm. Making unpopular decisions,
 > so you don't have to.

This is because:

 * I do get to the point, and quickly. That's very often perceived as
   blunt and rude, especially in angloamerican cultures, and is very
   appreciated in others (european, middle-eastern, for example).
 * while unavoidable, I despise politics: I emigrated because of them,
   and burnt a lot of bridges because of them too.
 * I do take technical decisions in the interest of the end-user, even
   though I wrote a whole page that states "I don't do this for you".
 * my technical decisions are based on my experience and interests,
   and not necessarily yours.
   
You can expect me to always combine my technical excellence  with high
sense of responsibility in my work.

Please note that it's not actual legal liability: that's why there's a
license in place that says "it's your problem if it breaks".

I will certainly not make it break intentionally: it would only reflect
negatively, both introspectively and from the outside observer.

I do care deeply for the quality of work being delivered to you, even
if you aren't paying me for it, or never even heard my name/nickname
before.
